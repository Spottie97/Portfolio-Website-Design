# Portfolio-Website-Design
This is the code I used to create my Portfolio Website. Credit to <a href =https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCObrjoZZJSjznfCO5Vx9qUQ> Webdecoded </a> for teaching me to use Node.js and React.

# What did I use?
-Node.js
-React
-Bootstrap

# The point of this project?
  I am trying to learn Node.js and some other frontend tools. I was also interested in creating this website to showcase my     projects in the future and to help advertise my work.

# How did you do it?
  I give full credit to <a href =https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCObrjoZZJSjznfCO5Vx9qUQ> Webdecoded </a>. When I started this project I had no idea what Node.js even was. After 2 hours and some trial and errors I got the hang of it and could write and edit my own code. If you are looking for the tutorial I used to learn how to do this you can check it out <a href =https://youtu.be/hYv6BM2fWd8> here </a>.
